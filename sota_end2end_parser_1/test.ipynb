    "text='From then on , the members continued their separate careers . Danny Boy founded an art company . DJ Lethal became a member of nu metal band Limp Bizkit , who would cover \" Jump Around \" at live concerts , particularly in Limp Bizkit \\'s early years during the Family Values Tour 1998 . Everlast achieved multi-platinum solo fame in 1998 with his album \\'\\' Whitey Ford Sings the Blues . \\'\\' The first single from that album was \" What It \\'s Like \" . In 2000 , a feud between Everlast and rapper Eminem coincided with the gold-selling \\'\\' Eat at Whitey \\'s \\'\\' , which included minor hits \" Black Jesus \" and \" Black Coffee \" , and featured a collaboration with Carlos Santana . After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records \\' master tapes to Warner Bros . Records , Everlast signed with Island/Def Jam , and released his \\'\\' White Trash Beautiful \\'\\' LP in 2004'"
